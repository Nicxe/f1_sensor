Thank you for your interest in contributing to f1_sensor!

## Branch model

This project uses a three-stage promotion model:

- `dev` — the active development branch. **All contributions must target this branch.**
- `beta` — pre-release testing. Promoted from `dev` by the maintainer.
- `main` — stable production releases. Promoted from `beta` by the maintainer.

The `beta` and `main` branches are managed exclusively by the maintainer. PRs targeting those branches are closed automatically.

## How to submit a pull request

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch based on `dev` in your fork.
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear messages.
4. Open a pull request against the **`dev`** branch of this repository.

## Questions

If you are unsure whether a change fits the project direction, open an issue before starting work. This prevents effort being spent on contributions that may not be accepted.
