![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-41BDF5.svg?style=) <img alt="Maintenance" src="https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2025"> <img alt="GitHub last commit" src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Nicxe/f1_sensor"> <img alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Nicxe/f1_sensor">


### OVERVIEW

The F1 Sensor integration connects Home Assistant with the Jolpica–F1 API to bring Formula 1 data into your smart home. And by leveraging Formula 1’s unofficial Live Timing API, the integration provides real-time updates on flag status and Safety Car conditions throughout each race weekend.


> [!TIP]
Visit the [F1 Sensor Community at Home Assistant Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/formula-1-racing-sensor/) to share your project and get help and inspiration.



### KEY FEATURES
- Lightweight, choose only the sensors you need  
- Real-time updates on flag and Safety Car status 
- Full timestamp support in UTC and local time  
- Current weather and forecast for the next race location, including expected conditions at race start
- Ideal for TTS, notifications, automations, and custom dashboards
- Automate your lights to flash red whenever a red flag is active during a session.
- Supports English and Swedish languages.

### ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL DETAILS 

##### Timezone
All race timestamps provided in UTC and as _local fields in the circuit’s timezone as an attribute to `sensor.f1_next_race`


##### Known issue
`sensor.f1_season_results` may trigger a warning in the Home Assistant logs:
```
Logger: homeassistant.components.recorder.db_schema
Source: components/recorder/db_schema.py:663
Integration: Recorder
State attributes for sensor.f1_season_results exceed maximum size of 16384 bytes. This can cause database performance issues; Attributes will not be stored
```

Exclude sensor.f1_season_results from recorder to prevent database performance issues
```
recorder:
  exclude:
    entities:
      - sensor.f1_season_results
```

#### Announce next race and top standings via TTS

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
  message: >
    {% set next_race = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_name') %}
    {% set race_date = as_datetime(state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_start_local')) %}
    {% set race_location = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_locality') %}
    {% set race_country = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_country') %}
    {% set days_left = (race_date.date() - now().date()).days %}
    {% set drivers = state_attr('sensor.f1_driver_standings', 'driver_standings') %}
    {% set constructors = state_attr('sensor.f1_constructor_standings', 'constructor_standings') %}
    The next Formula 1 race is the {{ next_race }} in {{ race_location }}, {{ race_country }}, happening in {{ days_left }} day{{ 's' if days_left != 1 else '' }}.
    The top 3 drivers right now are:
    Number 1: {{ drivers[0].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[0].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[0].points }} points.
    Number 2: {{ drivers[1].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[1].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[1].points }} points.
    Number 3: {{ drivers[2].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[2].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[2].points }} points.
    In the constructor standings:
    Number 1: {{ constructors[0].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[0].points }} points.
    Number 2: {{ constructors[1].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[1].points }} points.
    Number 3: {{ constructors[2].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[2].points }} points.
```


#### Mobile notification with race info and standings

```yaml
service: notify.mobile_app_yourdevice
data:
  title: "🏁 Formula 1 Update"
  message: >
    {% set race = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_name') %}
    {% set city = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_locality') %}
    {% set country = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_country') %}
    {% set race_time = as_datetime(state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_start_local')) %}
    {% set days = (race_time.date() - now().date()).days %}
    {% set drivers = state_attr('sensor.f1_driver_standings', 'driver_standings') %}
    {% set constructors = state_attr('sensor.f1_constructor_standings', 'constructor_standings') %}
    Next race: {{ race }} in {{ city }}, {{ country }} — in {{ days }} day{{ 's' if days != 1 else '' }}.
    Top drivers:
    1. {{ drivers[0].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[0].points }} pts)
    2. {{ drivers[1].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[1].points }} pts)
    3. {{ drivers[2].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[2].points }} pts)
    Top constructors:
    1. {{ constructors[0].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[0].points }} pts)
    2. {{ constructors[1].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[1].points }} pts)
    3. {{ constructors[2].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[2].points }} pts)
