    ## Lights out and away we go! 🏁

    This blueprint gives Formule 1 Race Control the posibility to control the lights in your house!


    <details>
    <summary><b>Parc fermé</b> 👈</summary>


    This blueprint is only usefull when setup correctly so please pay attention to the possibilitys as discribed below:

    If you have any questions, issues or ideas please submit it [here](https://github.com/Nicxe/f1_sensor/issues/new/) so it can be looked into.

    ## Testing

    To test this blueprint make sure that your selected `Race has ended` in `Race phase`

    After that you can change the status off the `Track state` sensor under [developer tools](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_states/).

    ## Track sensors

    - Session State: The sensors that reports the current race session state
      - Default: `sensor.f1_session_status`
    - Track State: The sensors that reports the current track state
      - Default: `sensor.f1_track_status`
    - Race phase: The blueprint will only run in the selected phases
      - Advised: `Race is on-going (live)`, `Race is suspended` and `Race has finished`

    ## Device tracker

    When a device is selected it checks if that device is currently home. If the device is not at home the blueprint will be canceled. When selected multiple devices it checks if at least one device is at home.
    If you dont select any device the state will be ignored and the blueprint will not stop running based on the device tracker.

    ## Do not disturb

    If turned on the blueprint will canceled if the current system time is between the start and end time.

    ## Light settings

    - 💡 Light to Control: The device that needs to be controlled

    - 🔆 Brightness Percentage: The brightness off the device that is controlled

    - 💨 Transition Time: The time between state changes
      - When you choose '0' the light will change immediately, that could be a bit annoying.

    ## Flag colors

    Give each flag it's own RGB color, you're lights will transform to this color based on flag status during the race

    - 🟩 Clear ('Green'): No problems on track, free to race
      - Default: `0`, `255`, `0`
    - 🟨 Yellow: Yellow flag has raised
      - Default: `255`, `255`, `0`
    - 🟥 Red: Race is suspended
      - Default: `255`, `0`, `0`

    ## (Virtual) Safety Car

    Specific settings for when there is a (Virtual) Safety Car on track

    - Virtual Safety Car: Color for when there is a virtual safety car
      - Default: `255`, `255`, `0`
    - Safety Car: COlor for when there is a safety car
      - Default: `255`, `0`, `0`
    - Flash for SC and VSC: Does the light needs to flash on a (virtual) safety car?
      - Default `on`
    - Flash Time: The time between pulsing on and off
      - Default: `1` second
