          This PR targets the \`$BASE_BRANCH\` branch, which is reserved for internal releases and managed exclusively by the maintainer.

          Please open a new PR targeting the \`dev\` branch instead. The branch workflow for this project is:
          - \`dev\` — where all contributions are merged and tested
          - \`beta\` — pre-release testing, promoted from \`dev\` by the maintainer
          - \`main\` — stable releases, promoted from \`beta\` by the maintainer

          You can change the base branch in GitHub's UI when creating the PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details. Thank you!"
